DeepaMehta Firefox Extension
============================

This Firefox extension allows you to bookmark the address of any webpage you are visiting with your browser as a "Web Resource" into a deepamehta server of your choice. Furthermore it enables you to store text (resp. hypertext) as a "Note" related to this "Web Resource". This extension also provides an experimental "DeepaMehta Toolbar" which shall help you to easily navigate to all "Web Resources", plus "Topic Maps" available in your deepamehta server. Such a "Topic Map" is an item specific to deepamehta and it facilitates _seeing_, _imagining_ and _showing_ of information, which basically can mean that it facilitates the communication of informations to _yourself_ and _others_. But to be able to start working with the benefits of such a topic map one needs to look out for the information of interest for one, and hang on to them.

DeepaMehta4 is a software platform designed as a think tool.
