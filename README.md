DeepaMehta4 Firefox Plugin
===========================

This DeepaMehta 3 Firefox plugin allows you to bookmark any information resource you are visiting in your browser. The name was simply derived from the book "back of the napkin". This plugin tries to facilitate you in the task of informational book keeping, good _looking_ (marking down notes). Once in use you can reveal all your marks and information resources in a geometrical landscape called topic map. A topic map facilitates _seeing_, _imagining_ and _showing_, which basically can mean that it facilitates the communication of informations to you and others. After the installation of the plugin you can start using it through pressing the "Notice"-Button (which you have to place in your toolbar before). Via 'ALT+T' + 'ALT+T' and then 'ALT+D' you also get kind of a quick access to all your bookmarks and topic maps.

DeepaMehta4 is a platform for thinking in collaboration.
